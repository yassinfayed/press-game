## Multiplayer Tap Sprint Game (there are more prompts that were used but they cover the same topic)


### Prompt: Time Synchronization
"Ensure that all players start the game at exactly the same time, even across different geographic locations. The server should send a start time, and clients should sync using time offsets."

### Prompt: Time Sync 1.1
"Socket connection is not transferred to the gamePlay.tsx component from the gameLobby.tsx component and i think that is the problem that causes the game to not start"

## Git & Deployment

### Prompt: adding git ignore for each subfolder
"I created a local repo and a remote GitHub repo called `press-game`. Give me the the gitignore files for the frontend and the server folders"
